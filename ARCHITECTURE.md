# Hope Facilitator System — architecture & API reference

This doc is the "how the pieces fit together" map for the Hope facilitator-assist system. It complements [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md) (platform integration recipe) and [deploy/OPERATIONS.md](deploy/OPERATIONS.md) (deploy + models + runbook) — read those for the *what to call when* and *how to deploy*. This doc is the *why it is shaped this way*.

---

## 1. System overview

Three services, no shared database, no synchronous chain:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Hope Move platform     │  ← cohorts, posts, replies, participant profile (Source of Truth)
└────────────┬────────────┘
             │  webhook / cron
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐    ┌───────────────────────────┐
│  hope-dashboard         │───▶│  comment_generation       │  Qwen3-4B + LoRA (HF Space or HPC)
│  (Next.js 16, Vercel)   │    │  FastAPI / port 8001      │  → drafts + memory + HITL
│                         │    └───────────────────────────┘
│  Server proxy layer     │    ┌───────────────────────────┐
│  signs HMAC, forwards   │───▶│  engagement_ml            │  RandomForest @ T∈{7,14,21,28,35,42}
│  HF_TOKEN, hides keys   │    │  FastAPI / port 8000      │  → dropout risk + SHAP factors
└─────────────────────────┘    └───────────────────────────┘
```

**Why three services, not one.** Each owns a different lifecycle:

- `engagement_ml` is read-heavy stateless inference (RandomForest pickle, no writes).
- `comment_generation` is read+write — drafts are inference, but the memory store and HITL log are persistent.
- `hope-dashboard` is the only UI surface — facilitators interact here; it never serves to the public Hope Move platform.

Splitting them means we scale and deploy each on its own cadence. The dashboard can be redeployed without restarting the GPU Space; the LoRA adapter can be swapped without touching the dropout models.

---

## 2. The dashboard (Next.js)

### 2.1 Routes

| Route | Source | Renders |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `src/app/page.tsx` | redirect to `/cohorts` |
| `/cohorts` | `src/app/cohorts/page.tsx` | cohort list (one card per `CohortMeta` in [src/lib/cohorts.ts](src/lib/cohorts.ts)) |
| `/cohorts/[cohortId]` | `src/app/cohorts/[cohortId]/page.tsx` (server) | 3-column dashboard: Queue • Detail • Drafts |
| `/api/proxy/*` | `src/app/api/proxy/**/route.ts` | server-side proxies that sign + forward to backend services |
| `/api/auth/*` | NextAuth v5 | dev-allowlist Credentials provider |

The cohort page is a **Server Component**. The three columns (Queue, Detail, Drafts) are client components reading from Zustand stores.

### 2.2 State (Zustand stores)

State is split by *concern*, not by component. Each store lives in [src/lib/store/](src/lib/store/) and is in-memory only — refresh wipes it. Persistent state (notes, snooze) lives on the backend in production; the dashboard mirrors it for the session.

| Store | Owns | Reset on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`uiStore`](src/lib/store/uiStore.ts) | `selectedParticipantId`, `selectedPostTs` | cohort change, participant change (post id) |
| [`scoringStore`](src/lib/store/scoringStore.ts) | `scoreAtWeek` (W1–W6), helpers `availableWeeks()` + `clampToProgrammeLength()` | never (week selector is global per session) |
| [`queueStore`](src/lib/store/queueStore.ts) | `snoozedUntil`, `dismissedAt` (per participant) | cohort change |
| [`notesStore`](src/lib/store/notesStore.ts) | local facilitator notes (per participant) | cohort change |
| [`sessionStatsStore`](src/lib/store/sessionStatsStore.ts) | `sentThisSession` counter for the topbar | never |

Cohort-change reset is centralised in [`CohortSessionReset`](src/components/cohort-session-reset.tsx), mounted on the cohort page. It fires once per `cohortId` change so participant-keyed state never leaks across cohorts (a participant can re-enrol under the same `user_id`).

### 2.3 Data flow per panel

```
src/lib/server/cohort-data.ts       (server-only)
    │  reads local/iih-coh*.json bundle (committed, per-cohort)
    ▼
useCohortBundle hook (TanStack Query, staleTime: ONE_DAY)
    │
    ├─▶ bundleToHistory(bundle, pid, scoreAtDay) → ParticipantHistory
    │       feeds /api/proxy/dropout/predict, /api/proxy/dropout/batch
    │       and /api/proxy/generate
    │
    └─▶ daysSinceLastEvent, facilitatorContactCount, etc. (src/lib/signals.ts)
            feeds the engagement-signals tile
```

All TanStack queries cache by `(cohortId, participantId, scoreAtDay)` — see [src/lib/hooks/api.ts](src/lib/hooks/api.ts). Missing `cohortId` would otherwise let the same participant id from two cohorts collide on cache.

### 2.4 Proxy layer

Every external API call goes through `/api/proxy/*`. This is the **only** place where secrets exist:

```
client component → fetch('/api/proxy/generate')
                          │
                          ▼  (server-only)
                  src/app/api/proxy/generate/route.ts
                          │
                          ├─ auth() → NextAuth session check
                          ├─ commentGen() returns a client with
                          │    HOPE_API_SECRET (HMAC) + HF_TOKEN
                          │    (Bearer for the private Space)
                          └─ POST https://...hf.space/generate
                                with X-HMAC-Signature header
```

This means:

- `HOPE_API_SECRET` and `HF_TOKEN` never leave the Node runtime.
- The browser only sees `/api/proxy/*` paths — never the upstream URLs or credentials.
- A 5xx from upstream is classified by [`classifyGenerateError`](src/app/cohorts/[cohortId]/drafts.tsx) into a friendly "Comment generation is offline" card; raw stack traces never reach facilitators.

---

## 3. comment_generation (the SLM service)

### 3.1 Pipeline

```
POST /generate
  │
  ├─ assess(post_text)              ← input safety (src/safety/input_filter.py)
  │    └─ hard block? → return acknowledgement-only drafts + signposting
  │
  ├─ memory_store.retrieve(...)     ← cohort-scoped, activity-type boosted
  │    sqlite at /app/outputs/memory.sqlite
  │
  ├─ engagement fingerprint         ← from request body OR panel.parquet
  │
  ├─ participant_context             ← future hook for profile data
  │
  ├─ persona selection              ← {Gratitude → 2 personas, else → 3}
  │
  ├─ HopeGenerator.generate_personas(...)
  │    │ system: SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION (8 rules, see src/config.py)
  │    │ user:   participant_context + memory + engagement + post + persona_suffix
  │    │ decode: Qwen3-4B + LoRA, 4-bit nf4 quant, sdpa attn, n-gram blocked
  │    │ post:   strip @mentions, fill [name] slot, collapse consecutive slots
  │
  ├─ output_filter.filter_output(...)  ← per draft: MI policy, score open-question / reflection / prescriptive density
  │
  ├─ HITLStore.log_drafts(...)         ← sqlite at /app/outputs/hitl.sqlite
  │
  └─ return GenerateResponse {drafts, draft_set_id, memory_used, engagement_used,
                              safety_signposting, model_version, generated_at}
```

### 3.2 Adapter swapping

`HOPE_GEN_MODEL_ID` (env var) selects which LoRA loads. Three forms:

- HF Hub id with slash: `michaelajao/qwen3-4b-hope-forum-clean-lora` → `snapshot_download` + cache to `/data/.cache/huggingface`
- Local registry id (no slash): `qwen3-4b-hope-only` → look up `MODEL_ID_TO_DIR` in [generation_service.py](../comment_generation/service/generation_service.py) → `models/<dir>/`
- Anything else: error at startup

LoRA weights download once on first `/generate`; subsequent requests reuse the in-memory model. Cold-boot is ~30–90s on T4 (base download dominates); warm is sub-second.

### 3.3 Safety surfaces

- **Input filter** (`src/safety/input_filter.py`) — assesses post_text for crisis content. `blocked=True` short-circuits to acknowledgement-only drafts + a `safety_signposting` string.
- **Output filter** (`src/safety/output_filter.py`) — every persona draft passes through. Substitutes `[name]` slot, strips `@mentions`, scores MI signature, may rewrite if policy violations exceed threshold.
- **Kill switch** — `HOPE_DISABLE_GENERATION=1` returns the safe-stub drafts with `model_version: "stub-disabled"`. Use this to take the SLM offline without taking the service down.

### 3.4 Memory store

SQLite, idempotent on `(activity_id, role)`. Two tables — `post` and `reply`. Retrieval is cohort-scoped + activity-type boosted, top-K with K=3 by default.

Why SQLite, not Postgres: single-machine inference service, no distributed locks needed. Mounted on `/data` for the HF Space (persistent volume). Backfillable from JSON exports via `hope-memory backfill` CLI.

### 3.5 HITL store

SQLite, table per signal kind: `drafts` (every shown draft), `thumbs` (up/down), `events` (accept/edit/reject/flag/send), `safety_decisions`. Used downstream for DPO/KTO preference training and quality auditing.

---

## 4. engagement_ml (the dropout service)

### 4.1 Pipeline

```
POST /predict (or /batch)
  │
  ├─ feature builder: 6 weeks of event history → 50+ engineered features
  │    (cumulative logins, inactive streaks, activity ranges, page visits,
  │     bookmark count, reply rate, facilitator contact count, ...)
  │
  ├─ load_winner(score_at_day) → models/winner_T{T}.pkl
  │    one RandomForest per horizon; T ∈ {7,14,21,28,35,42}
  │
  ├─ Platt calibration → models/platt_T{T}.pkl
  │    raw probability → calibrated dropout_risk
  │
  ├─ risk_tier classification: low / medium / high (per per-cohort cutoffs)
  │
  ├─ TreeSHAP → top-3 contributing factors with weights (recommended_actions
  │    look up tier-keyed playbook strings)
  │
  └─ return PredictionResponse {dropout_probability, dropout_risk,
                                risk_tier, risk_level,
                                contributing_factors[], contributing_factor_weights[],
                                recommended_actions[], model_version,
                                threshold_used, threshold_low, threshold_high}
```

### 4.2 Why per-horizon models

A single end-of-programme model would weight late-engagement features too heavily for early-week scoring. Six smaller models (one per horizon) means a W1 score has W1-relevant features dominate; W6 score has the late-engagement features dominate. Validated AUC: ~0.94 LOCO.

The dashboard's week selector (W1–W6) maps each week to one trained horizon. The dashboard caps available weeks at `min(programmeLengthDays/7, 6)` because the trained set has no T=49 model; a 12-week cohort can still be scored but only up to W6 with `note: "horizon_used: 42"`.

### 4.3 Cadence

Production should run a **weekly batch** per cohort and store results in a `weekly_predictions` table. The dashboard renders from that table; on-demand `/predict` calls are for new/manual refresh only. See INTEGRATION.md §2 for the full recipe.

---

## 5. Request lifecycles

### 5.1 Generate a draft

```
Facilitator clicks "Generate drafts" on a participant post
  │
  │ Drafts panel → useGenerate.mutate({participant_id, cohort_id, post_text, ...})
  ▼
POST /api/proxy/generate                      (Next.js server, NodeJS runtime)
  │
  │  auth() → session check (NextAuth)
  │  commentGen() builds an HMAC-signing client with HF_TOKEN bearer
  │  forward POST to https://...hf.space/generate
  ▼
HF Space FastAPI
  │
  │  require_hmac() validates the X-HMAC-Signature
  │  drafts router runs the pipeline (see §3.1)
  ▼
return GenerateResponse → /api/proxy/generate passthrough → Drafts panel renders DraftCard
```

End-to-end: cold ~30s (model load on first call), warm 1–3s per generation.

### 5.2 Score a cohort

```
Cohort page mounts → Queue useMemo builds ParticipantHistory[] from cohort bundle
  │
  │ useCohortBatch(histories, cohort.id)  ← TanStack, staleTime: ONE_DAY
  ▼
POST /api/proxy/dropout/batch              (Next.js server)
  │
  │  X-API-Key: HOPE_RISK_API_KEY (NOT HMAC — different service)
  │  forward POST to engagement_ml
  ▼
engagement_ml FastAPI
  │
  │  Per participant: feature builder → load_winner(T) → Platt calibrate → TreeSHAP
  ▼
return BatchResponse → /api/proxy/dropout/batch → Queue renders ranked list
```

### 5.3 Send a draft

```
Facilitator clicks "Send"
  │
  │ useEvent.mutate({draft_id, action: "accept" | "edit", sent_text})
  ▼
POST /api/proxy/event → comment_generation
  │
  │  HITLStore writes events row
  │  memory_store writes a reply row (for next call's retrieval)
  ▼
onSuccess: queryClient.invalidateQueries(["memory", ...])
           sessionStatsStore.incrementSent()
```

## 6. Auth surfaces

Two schemes, by design:

| Service | Scheme | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| comment_generation | HMAC-SHA256 over raw body | Mutates state (memory, HITL); signature binds payload to caller. |
| engagement_ml | `X-API-Key: $HOPE_RISK_API_KEY` | Pure inference; simple bearer is enough. |

Both services accept `HOPE_API_AUTH=disabled` in dev/smoke. Production sets it to anything else (`enabled` is conventional).

The dashboard's `/api/proxy/*` routes are the only HMAC signers — they read `HOPE_API_SECRET` from server env, sign the outbound body, and forward. No client-side code ever sees the secret.

The HF Space layer adds another auth gate: the Space is **Private**, so every request to `https://...hf.space/*` needs `Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN`. The dashboard's [createCommentGenClient](src/lib/api/commentGen.ts) forwards `authToken` for this. See INTEGRATION.md §1 for the HMAC example.

---

## 7. API surface — summary

Full reference: [comment_generation/docs/openapi.yaml](../comment_generation/docs/openapi.yaml) for comment-gen; INTEGRATION.md §2–§3 for both. Quick map:

### comment_generation (`comment-api`, port 8001)

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/` | open | landing JSON (also satisfies HF Space root probe) |
| GET | `/health` | open | `{status, model_loaded, memory_db, dropout_api, timestamp}` |

---

## 8. Data sources

| Item | Location | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cohort bundle | `local/iih-coh*.json` (**committed** — see below) | dashboard | extracted by [`scripts/extract-iih-cohort.mjs`](scripts/extract-iih-cohort.mjs) from raw txt exports; pseudonymised |
| Memory store | `/app/outputs/memory.sqlite` | comment_generation | created on first connect via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`; persistent on `/data` for HF Space |
| HITL store | `/app/outputs/hitl.sqlite` | comment_generation | same lifecycle as memory; sole source for DPO/KTO training data |
| LoRA adapter | `michaelajao/qwen3.5-4b-hope-forum-lora` (default) | HF Hub (private) | swappable via `HOPE_GEN_MODEL_ID` / picker; downloads to HF cache on first use. Full roster in [deploy/OPERATIONS.md](deploy/OPERATIONS.md) §2 |
| Base model | `Qwen/Qwen3-4B` | HF Hub (public) | downloaded by `transformers.from_pretrained` |
| Dropout models | `engagement_ml/models/winner_T{7..42}.pkl` | engagement_ml | per-horizon RandomForest; Platt calibration files alongside |
| Engagement panel | `cumulative_features_panel.parquet` | engagement_ml | optional; comment_generation falls back to request-body engagement when missing |

**The cohort bundles in `local/` are committed and contain real Hope Move
platform data.** Direct identifiers (names, emails, phones) are stripped
before export and display names are pseudonymised to `P1`, `P2`, … — but
the post free-text is genuine participant writing and includes health
disclosures. Treat this repository as confidential.

Anything added downstream (the dashboard, the LoRA training) must not
re-introduce identifiers — see the name-scrub path in
[`src/generation_utils.py:scrub_first_names`](../comment_generation/src/generation_utils.py)
for the training-side guard.

The raw platform exports the bundles are built from (`data/` in
`comment_generation` and `engagement_ml`) are **gitignored** in those
repos and must stay that way.

---

## 9. Failure modes & observability

| Failure | Where it's caught | What the facilitator sees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Space down / 5xx | [`classifyGenerateError`](src/app/cohorts/[cohortId]/drafts.tsx) | "Comment generation is offline" card |
| 401 from upstream | same classifier | "Sign in again" card |
| Input safety block | comment_generation pipeline | 2 acknowledgement-only drafts + `safety_signposting` string |
| Kill switch (`HOPE_DISABLE_GENERATION=1`) | comment_generation `/generate` | safe-stub drafts with `model_version: "stub-disabled"` |
| Memory store unreachable | dashboard memory proxy | empty memory rows; generation still runs |
| risk-api unreachable | TanStack `error` state | inline "predictions unavailable" + retry |

Container logs are the authoritative trace — `print(traceback)` is the runtime, plus the `/health` endpoint reports `model_loaded`, `memory_db`, and `dropout_api` status. Future work: forward HITL signals to a metrics pipeline.

---

## 10. Deployment topology

| Layer | Today | Production target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dashboard | local Next.js dev server | Vercel |
| comment_generation | HF Space (Docker SDK, T4 small) | same, or self-hosted GPU via `docker compose` |
| engagement_ml | HF Space (free CPU) | same, or self-hosted via `docker compose` |
| Memory + HITL | `/data` on the HF Space volume | persistent volume on the self-host box |
| Secrets | `.env.local` on dev box + HF Space settings | host env / secret manager of the hosting platform |

Each layer is independently scalable. The dashboard is stateless. comment_generation pins to one instance per LoRA (state lives in the sqlite volume); horizontal scale needs Postgres + Redis. engagement_ml is fully stateless (pure RandomForest inference) — scale freely.

---

## 11. Where to look first

| If you're investigating… | Start in |
| --- | --- |
| A wrong draft showed up | container log on the Space + `model_version` in the response |
| A participant's risk score looks off | `/api/proxy/dropout/predict` response in browser network tab + `model_version` |
| Queue not re-ranking after week change | scoringStore + `useCohortBatch` cache key (must include `scoreAtDay` + `cohortId`) |
| "Memory not used" but should be | `/memory/{participant_id}` via the proxy + `memory_used` in `/generate` response |
| Send action silently failed | `events` table in `hitl.sqlite` on the Space |
| Adding a new persona | `Persona` enum in `comment_generation/service/models.py` + `_PERSONA_SUFFIX` in `generation_service.py` + persona routing in `drafts.py` |
| Adding a new cohort | `src/lib/cohorts.ts` + bundle export at `local/iih-coh*.json` + cohort metadata (programmeLengthDays) |
| Swapping the LoRA | set `HOPE_GEN_MODEL_ID` on the Space; factory-reboot |

---

## 12. Architectural decisions worth knowing

1. **Two auth schemes, not one.** HMAC binds the payload (right for state-mutating writes); X-API-Key is enough for pure inference. Unifying would push complexity onto the simpler service for no gain.
2. **SQLite, not Postgres.** Single-instance LoRA service; no distributed locks needed. Easy to back up (one file). Swap to Postgres only when scale demands replicas.
3. **LoRA, not full fine-tune.** ~5–10MB swappable weights vs 8GB full model. Faster iteration, cheaper cold boot, DPO/KTO-friendly.
4. **Server proxies, not direct browser calls.** `HOPE_API_SECRET` and `HF_TOKEN` never reach the client. Single auth surface to audit. Lets us add caching/transform layers without touching client code.
5. **mailto:, not server-side email.** Cheap-path outreach for disengaged participants. Server-side SMTP via NextAuth/Resend lands when the workflow demands tracking.
6. **Activity-aware persona selection.** Gratitude posts get 2 personas (Empathetic + Goal-oriented); everything else gets 3. Nudging next steps in response to gratitude reads as tone-deaf — the heuristic respects the Hope handbook.
7. **Cohort-scoped session state.** Stores reset when the `cohortId` route param changes ([CohortSessionReset](src/components/cohort-session-reset.tsx)). Participant ids can repeat across cohorts (re-enrolment); the reset prevents state bleed.
8. **`[name]` slot, not name interpolation.** Training data substitutes raw first names with `[name]`; inference fills it with the live display_name. Combined with the system-prompt naming rule (config.py rule 8) and the data-prep scrubber, this is the three-layer defence against PII leakage from the training set.
9. **Weekly batch + on-demand refresh** for risk scoring. Consistent numbers across facilitators, cheap (~1 batch/cohort/week), historical trajectory available. See INTEGRATION.md §2.
